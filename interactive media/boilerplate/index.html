<h2>Week2 Questions</h2>
<h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h2>
<p>While I was visiting the website I tried to click all available choices.  Every time I tried to choose options which do not reveal my personal information those options disappear. When I accept options which may contain my personal information some website with loud music and horror pictures appear. I finished browsing the website with apprehension. Because I have to choose those options  which need to give my personal information. After I choose those options loud nosies or scary images must come out. </p>

<h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
<p>The first thing I paid attention is massive windows and floating buttons. It creates a feeling of my computer has been invaded by virus.</p>

<h2>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>

<div class="questions">
<h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
<p>During the first two minutes of browsing, I clicked my mouse a lot. Because the website provides a lot of information to me. The website indicate my action by these windows. In the same time it limits actions I can do in the website.</p>
<h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
<p>The intended primary goal is to to pass web creator’s idea on information safety and unsatisfied on some users’ policy. When visitors try to choose options which refuse giving personal information these options will disappear. It alludes the fact that nowadays many apps, webs and softwares ask users to accept their users policy otherwise users can not access any functions. Those users policy are filled with difficult words and traps. In the website “tetrageddn”, the result of accepting those users’ policy is really simple it leads us to websites which show many horror images.</p>
<h2>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h2>
<p>These goal achieved by visual effects, notification windows stacking together and options floating on the window. When visitors trying to cross windows will make the error sound. Furthermore, the background image are burning fires and the website name also shows the urgent situation. These following elements reflects on our life nowadays. With the developing of technology, many products are becoming more and more complicated. Functions may provide convince to users but it can also steal users’ information in one click.</p>
<h2>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h2>
<p>The intended length of a single interaction is around 1 minute. Some options in the website link to a video, a description on the purpose of tetrageddon and a little game. During the whole process of using this website I spent around 5 minutes experienced all functions in the website. One little game is around 1 minutes however I think this website is an informal website so after I experience all functions I will never search the website again. This website inform audiences what is tetrageddon and the purpose of making this website. After audiences acknowledge these information  the purpose of the website achieved.
</p>
<h2>Week3 Questions</h2>
<h2>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h2>
<p>Metaphors utilising in the website is a classic desktop desktop metaphor</p>
<img src="img/Main.png" height="300px" alt="tetrageddon as example">
<p>This is the main page for tetrageddon. In this picture we can see windows, icons and pointers are all samiliar with interface on our own computer. This metaphor leads audiences can easily understand what they need to do and where can they click. Furthermore, context gives audiences metaphor as well. Advertising, notification, requesting email, these words make audiences feel their unconfortable because the website is asking too much on audiences' personal information. It deliberately make audiences want to refuse these requests. When audiences choose these reject options those buttoms will disappear and make error sound. Another metaphors provide by these new information, users can only choose to accept these options. The result is obvious, loud noise and horror videos will play when audiences choose to accept. This is a metaphor on apps we are using everyday. Websites ask us to accept cookies, apps require users to provide their personal information. </p>
<h2>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h2>
<p>This reference is trying hard to make me feel uncomfortable. It gives me a feeling of my computer has been invaded by virus. I do not want to accept any of options the website provides to me.  </p>
<h2>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h2>
<p>The frustrating part is my browse will crash sometimes when I open this website. I need to do all my options again, I really don't want to want these zombie videos and listen to loud noises again.</p>
<h2>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h2>
<p>The most satisfying elements are the these pixel artworks, I am a fan of pixel artworks. The old school style attracts me. The intended goal of the website is meanigful as well. </p>
